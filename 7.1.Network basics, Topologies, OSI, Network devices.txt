Network basics, Topologies, OSI, Network devices 

------------------------------------------------------

Network:
A network is a collection of interconnected devices or points 
allowing the sharing of information and resources through physical or wireless connections.

------------------------------------------------------

Topology:
Topology refers to the arrangement or structure of how devices or nodes are interconnected within a network.

------------------------------------------------------

Type of topologies:

Star Topology: Each device connects to a central hub or switch.
Ring Topology: Devices form a closed-loop where data travels in a circular path.
Tree Topology: Hierarchical connections resembling a tree structure.
Mesh Topology: All devices interconnect to eachother (but one node not connected to all of computers)

------------------------------------------------------

Type of networks:

1. PAN (Personal Area Network): Connects personal devices within a close range, like smartphones and laptops.
2. LAN (Local Area Network): Links devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or building.
3. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): A type of LAN using wireless technology like Wi-Fi for connections.
4. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Spans across a city or metropolitan area, connecting multiple LANs.
5. SAN (Storage Area Network): Connects storage devices to servers, facilitating centralized data storage and retrieval.
6. WAN (Wide Area Network): Connects devices across a wide geographical area or between countries.
7. VPN (Virtual Private Network): Enables secure communication over public networks like the internet.
8. EPN (Enterprise Private Network): A private network used within an organization or corporation for internal communications.

------------------------------------------------------

IP (Internet Protocol): A protocol used for sending and receiving data across networks. It provides a unique address for devices to communicate within a network. It's divided into versions IPv4 and IPv6.

------------------------------------------------------

MAC Address (Media Access Control Address): A unique hardware identifier for network devices assigned by the hardware (like a network card). These addresses are typically 12- or 6-byte numbers displayed in hexadecimal format (e.g., "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E").

------------------------------------------------------

Protocol: In tech, protocols are rules guiding how devices/systems interact within a network, specifying data formats, transmission methods, and security measures.

------------------------------------------------------

OSi model:
Conceptual framework for how 7 network layers works

1.Application Layer
2.Presentation Layer
3.Session Layer
4.Transport Layer
5.Network Layer
6.Data Link Layer
7.Physical Layer

------------------------------------------------------

How data transfer in network:

- Data encapsulate 7 times from leyer 1 to 7
- Then trvel in network in 0,1 format
- Finaly decapsulate from layer 7 to 1.


------------------------------------------------------

Network devices:

- Modem: A device that establishes your connection to the internet.
- Router: A device that directs data packets between networks (works with IP, it can join two networks).
- Switch: A network device that manages communication between different devices in a network (works with MAC, it can't join two networks).
- Hub: A simple network device that broadcasts data to all devices connected to it.

We have modem router in real life
